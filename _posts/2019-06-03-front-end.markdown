## Outline of work

The front-end work completed in alpha primarily focused on demonstrating data querying.
* A common pain point discovered in user research sessions was the large amount time spent answering questions or FOI requests.
  * Both delivery partners and BEIS users had to search through thousands of rows of data to find specific information.
* By setting up a taxonomy driven search and filter system, this time can be reduced by allowing users to filter data quickly by quarter, country, category or description.
  * This was built using both pre-populated drop-downs and a keyword search system.

### Build Tools

The front-end was designed using classes and SASS styles from the [GovUK front-end repository](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/){:target="_blank"}  . It was installed as an npm package using the following command:


{% highlight ruby %}
npm install govuk-frontend
{% endhighlight %}

The pages have been structured as per the UX designs which can be found here: [ux designs](https://govuk-beis-odart-ux.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"}  .

The build comprises a web application built in React, which was chosen as it is open source, well documented and due to its single-page abilities is able to load and query large quantities of data very quickly.
