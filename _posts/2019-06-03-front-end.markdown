## Outline of work

The front-end work completed in alpha primarily focused on demonstrating data querying.
* A common pain point discovered in user research sessions was the large amount time spent answering questions or FOI requests.
  * Both delivery partners and BEIS users had to search through thousands of rows of data to find specific information.
* By setting up a taxonomy driven search and filter system, this time can be reduced by allowing users to filter data quickly by quarter, country, category or description.
  * This was built using both pre-populated drop-downs and a keyword search system.
