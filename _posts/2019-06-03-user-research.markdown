## Introduction

This document suggests the next steps for research in the private Beta phase of ODART.

## Research Insights
1. [Research insights](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FvwfzqlUziGdB5irZctDrwkMluJ6d5RSXXwYj0EaIgY/edit){:target="_blank"}   show a list of core insights mapped during our initial research process. Below you can find elements that helped us prepare for and synthesise the insights:

## Research plan for beta

## Objectives

1. Learn from Alpha and previous discovery research
  * Understand whether/ how to best iterate existing service prototypes from Alpha
2. Understand the needs, perceptions and behaviours of the user groups not included in Alpha phase research (in-country teams & regional leads)
3. Get meaningful feedback about prototypes on an ongoing basis

## Activities

1. Download research from Alpha and previous discovery phase
  * Identify knowledge gaps
  * Shape hypotheses and questions for further research

2. 1-1 interviews with new user groups
  * Speak to 3-5 representatives of each group, focusing on understanding their context, needs, behaviours and perceptions
    * How do they interact with ODART data, and the organisations involved in the BEIS ecosystem?
      * What tools are they using? How do they feel about them?
      * Who do they interact with the most and how?
      * How do they feel about the current way of doing things?
      * How do they imagine a better way of doing things?
  * Generate insights
  * Consider adding new profiles to the ones created in Alpha

3. Test prototype(s) with users across all groups if possible
  * Review existing prototypes & last user testing from Alpha and consider iterating on the prototypes
    * Test your prototypes regularly across user groups to generate meaningful insights for development
      * Consider testing every sprint/ fortnightly to optimise learning
